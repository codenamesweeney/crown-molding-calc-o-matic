# Sweeney's 10k Crown Molding Calc-O-Matic

This is a simple but hopefully clear crown-molding calculator that records the angles you enter, calculates the miter and bevel angles, and provides a diagram to help you visualize and plan the cuts you'll need to make.

The Calc-O-Matic uses local browser storage so you can measure, note, and calculate all the angles for a given room, and still have access to the data when you finally head out to the saw and make your cuts. The saw diagram runs off some simple JavaScript and CSS3 tranforms.

I created this project as an entry for the [2016 10k Apart Contest] (https://a-k-apart.com/), but my goal was also to create a tool that would be useful to me: I'm an avid DIYer roughly midway through the process of installing crown molding in my own home; I wish I'd had a Calc-O-Matic like this on the day I started.

Feedback is always welcome. Thanks for your interest.
